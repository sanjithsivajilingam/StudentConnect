# StudentConnect
## About
StudentConnect was created by a team of four peers to address the impact of COVID-19 on academic setbacks and foster communication among isolated students. The website helps students regain academic momentum and facilitates peer-to-peer interaction through progress tracking, earning points, and redeeming them for prizes.
This project was created during Devpost's Treasure Hacks 3.0 hackathon.
